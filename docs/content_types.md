Content Types
========

This is a page where you can tell a little bit about the content types used in the website and how they're used. 
For example it is nice to read if something comes from **feeds**, if some content types shouldn't be accessible as nodes, but are just listed somewhere and so on. As usual, try to keep it simple: if your docs are fast and easy to read, you have more chance people will actually use them!

#Basic page
Nothing special here: body and an image. The pages are directly linked from the main menu.
